Title: fastseg - a fast segmentation algorithm
Description: fastseg implements a very fast and efficient segmentation
        algorithm. It has similar functionality as DNACopy (Olshen and
        Venkatraman 2004), but is considerably faster and more
        flexible. fastseg can segment data from DNA microarrays and
        data from next generation sequencing for example to detect copy
        number segments. Further it can segment data from RNA
        microarrays like tiling arrays to identify transcripts. Most
        generally, it can segment data given as a matrix or as a
        vector. Various data formats can be used as input to fastseg
        like expression set objects for microarrays or GRanges for
        sequencing data. The segmentation criterion of fastseg is based
        on a statistical test in a Bayesian framework, namely the cyber
        t-test (Baldi 2001). The speed-up arises from the facts, that
        sampling is not necessary in for fastseg and that a dynamic
        programming approach is used for calculation of the segments'
        first and higher order moments.
